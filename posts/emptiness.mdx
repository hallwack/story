Ever since you sit in your comfy room, you have a smart TV; high-end laptops & PCs, 100MiB/s internet, comfort chair, even Nintendo Switch. You have a couple of good books to read, interesting thoughts to write, and some crazy reflection to draw.
<br />
But you do nothing.
<br />
<br />
You don't know what to do.
<br />
<br />
You spend time sitting in front of stupid computers for 8 hours a day, talking bullshit on the Slack channels every day and writing boring code just like everyone else does. You know who you are in your 9to5 but the rest you are a nobody.
<br />
<br />
Just a name with an empty soul.
<br />
<br />
Maybe you have a dream, but you choose to keep your dream, dream.
<br />
<br />
Maybe you have friends, but those are just Instagram users.
<br />
<br />
Maybe you have a nice watch, but have no time.
<br />
<br />
You then realize that you are not as strong as your sweet 17's.
<br />
<br />
You then realize that you don't have as much time as before though every day is still 24 hours.
<br />
<br />
Your energy is spent doing nothing but work.
<br />
<br />
You have enough money in your savings, nice stocks to trade, and some cryptocurrencies to keep. You can buy anything yet happiness is always priceless.
<br />
<br />
Who the hell needs happiness, anyway?
<br />
<br />
Then you see how people live their lives.
<br />
<br />
You sure you're happy yet all you do is laugh.
<br />
<br />
Mouth can lie but your heart can't, as you know.
<br />
<br />
There is a strange feeling in your little heart. You don't know exactly what it is but you're sure it feel like an emptiness as it's not your very first time.
<br />
<br />
You know what you have to do but you choose to not to.
<br />
<br />
You need someone to talk and know it's not Siri.
<br />
<br />
Not even your phone.
<br />
<br />
Or your refrigerator.
<br />
<br />
You know the name but not the person.
<br />
<br />
You have deep regrets but don't want to change anything.
<br />
<br />
You open Netflix but what you want to see is not there
<br />
<br />
You open Discord, Telegram, Signal, but no one you want to contact there.
<br />
<br />
Nobody knows what happened but you.
<br />
<br />
Then you choose to sleep.
<br />
<br />
Forget anything and forgive everything.
<br />
<br />
Next morning you wake up, eat, and sit in front of stupid computer again.
<br />
<br />
You say "new day, new me" yet it's still the same just like yesterday.
<br />
<br />
And then you write this shit and save it in a draft.
<br />
<br />
You know it won't change anything even if you publish it anywhere yet you know it won't change anything if you keep it in draft anyway.
<br />
<br />
You click publish.
<br />
<br />
Emptiness is still there but you know it's a different one.
<br />
<br />
You know you just need to talk as your head can't keep it any longer.
<br />
<br />
Then something falls in your eyes.
<br />
<br />
You know tears won't change anything yet you know it won't change anything if you don't cry anyway.
<br />
<br />
Then you realize that emptiness is a part of who you are.
<br />
<br />
Because every time emptiness knocks on your door, you let it in.
<br />
<br />
Always.
<br />
<br />
Life is always about choice and that's what you choose.
